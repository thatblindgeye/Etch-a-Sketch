This is my version of the Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project, styled after the actual
Etch-a-Sketch toy. Includes:

1.  the ability to click within the grid to turn the drawing on or off.
2.  the option for user to select a specific color with the color picker.
3.  the ability to choose between 3 pen options: solid, gradient, or random.
    - both the solid and gradient options use the color selected by user.
    - the gradient option starts with 10% transparency and increases by 10% each time a cell
      is moused over.
    - the random option fills each cell with a random color.

4.  Allow user to toggle cell borders on/off DONE
5.  Create shaking animation for grid when create/clear button is pressed DONE

    visual tweaks
