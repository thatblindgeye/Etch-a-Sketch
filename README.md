My version of the Etch-a-Sketc project for The Odin Project.

Plans:

1. Allow user to choose a color to sketch with
2. Allow user to choose a gradient option to increase opacity with each mouseover
3. Allow user to choose a randomRGB option to have each cell result in a random color?
4. Allow user to toggle cell borders on/off?
